summary: "Discussion of the article 'A RNA theory of natural universal computation' published here: https://bit.ly/3BrVfqt."
abstract: "Today the project welcomes [Hessam Akhlaghpour](https://lifeiscomputation.com/) to talk about his recent article [A RNA theory of natural universal computation](https://bit.ly/3BrVfqt) recently published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology. His article is of particular interest to the project because it provides of a new formal model in biology that brings a new understanding to mechanisms of intercellular comunication for the development of: Cooperation in multicellular organisms and Rapid communication across cells. Remarkably this model is very much a complement and expansion from Ron Maimon's [ideas about computation and life](https://galapagos.netlify.app/publication/ron_maimon_biology/) that we recently pay a tribute in the project."
