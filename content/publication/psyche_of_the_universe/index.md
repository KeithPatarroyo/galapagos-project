abstract: "Following [Brower's philosophy](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/notre-dame-journal-of-formal-logic/volume-37/issue-3/Life-Art-and-Mysticism/10.1305/ndjfl/1039886518.full) ,this text starts from the idea that a theory of creation is fundamentally impossible to capture by words. But even if that is the case, it purposely embarks us on a failed journey to describe how we currently best understand the engine of creation itself. The theories of natural and cultural evolution attempt to capture the phenomenon of creation of biology and humanity, this underlying phenomenon bringing about change is the Psyche of the Universe.  By describing a possible description of this phenomenon, we slowly reveal that one naturally needs to incorporate other elements(love and action) of human nature to 'bring alive' the technical ideas. However this process seems to be impossible to describe in a recipe, it should be acted on by the world and it should be nurtured by some unknown element we describe as love."
