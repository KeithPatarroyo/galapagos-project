abstract: Ron Maimon is a theoretical biologist and physicist that was very active at the beginning of the 2010s in question-and-answer websites like the [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) family of sites and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/?share=1). There he answered over 2500+ technical questions in topics such as physics, mathematics, biology, among others until his eventual [departure](http://quoracast.com/ron-maimon-truther/). In this collected works my aim is to present a compendium of all Ron’s online content related to the ideas of biology, computation, and the origins of life. Even though some of the high level ideas of an [algorithmic origin of life](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2012.0869) or a [collective cell intelligence](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2019.0750) and [neural darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Darwinism) are already known in the technical literature,  I can mostly say that many of Ron’s fine grain ideas are highly original, but to my knowledge unconfirmed. Therefore I believe that at the very least these compendium present a new perspective to the field of life origins or cognitive science and can be of value to any researcher on the field.
