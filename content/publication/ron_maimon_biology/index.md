abstract: Ron Maimon is a theoretical biologist and physicist that was very active at the beginning of the 2010s in question-and-answer websites like the [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) family of sites and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/?share=1). In this collected works my aim is to present an organized account of all Ron Maimon's content available online related to the ideas of biology, computation, and the origins of life. I believe that at the very least they present a new perspective to the field of life origins and can be of value to any researcher on the field.
