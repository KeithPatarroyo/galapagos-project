Nicolas Drapeau obtained his M.Sc in Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University. He currently works to develop a new philosophy of mathematics that goes beyond the traditional notions of rationalism and empiricism. The philosophy attempts to describe mathematics as a form of Life that evolves just like biological life. He is also a member of the clubs: [Life is what!?](https://www.clubhouse.com/club/life-is-what) and [Goedel Parallax](https://www.clubhouse.com/club/godels-parallax) in Clubhouse.

A short description of his training, he was taught synthetic philosophy of mathematics by [Fernando Zalamea](https://unal.academia.edu/FernandoZalamea), metamathematics by [Stephen Wolfram](https://www.stephenwolfram.com/), individuality and thories of life by [David Krakauer](https://davidckrakauer.com/) and embodied cognition by [Rafael Nuñez](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/~nunez/web/index.html), inter alia.
