Nicolas Drapeau obtained his M.Sc in Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University. He currently works to develop a new philosophy of mathematics that goes beyond the traditional notions of rationalism and empiricism. The philosophy attempts to describe mathematics as a form of Life that evolves just like biological life. He is also a member of the clubs: [Life is what!?](https://www.clubhouse.com/club/life-is-what) and [Goedel Parallax](https://www.clubhouse.com/club/godels-parallax) in Clubhouse.

A short description of his training, he was taught the principles of computation by [W. Daniel Hillis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danny-hillis-37b16167/), how to make machines that make machines by [Neil Gershenfeld](http://ng.cba.mit.edu/), building self-constructing spaceship by [Adam P. Goucher](https://mobile.twitter.com/apgox).
