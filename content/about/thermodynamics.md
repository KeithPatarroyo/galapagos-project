The concepts of entropy, energy, heat, and information have been puzzling scientists for centuries. Different frameworks have been proposed to understand these concepts, some of them are [Classical Thermodynamics](https://www.amazon.com/Lectures-Theoretical-Physics-Thermodynamics-Statistical/dp/0126546827), [Kinetic theory](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~sjb/ctp/), [Statistical Mechanics](https://sethna.lassp.cornell.edu/StatMech/), [Axiomatic Thermodynamics](https://www.ams.org/notices/199805/lieb.pdf), [Information Theory](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.106.620), [Statistical Estimation](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1704105), [Optimal Transport & Information Geometry](https://www.amazon.com/Optimal-Transportation-Graduate-Studies-Mathematics/dp/082183312X), [Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ab0850/meta), and recently [Constructor Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.02625.pdf). Each of the frameworks has enlightened applications in chemistry, plasma physics, quantum mechanics, computation, pure mathematics, and even in applied fields like biology, statistics, and signal processing. Each perspective helps build a more complete picture of the nature of matter and information and its understanding is helping even in foundational questions like the nature of [time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02217.pdf).

- An effort in this line of inquiry is directed towards the formulation of the thermodynamics of [universal constructors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.02625.pdf), and their consequences for the nature of computation, biology, and time.
- Another line of effort is to use the frameworks of description for thermodynamics for connection with other fields, like [symplectic geometry](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/08/08/information-geometry-part-19/), Information Geometry, [Quantum Mechanics](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1018811305766.pdf), and use it for applications in imaging and statistics.
