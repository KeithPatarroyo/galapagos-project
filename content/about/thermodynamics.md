The concepts of entropy, energy, heat and information have been puzzling scientists for centuries. Different frameworks have been proposed to understand these concepts, some of them are Classical Thermodynamics, Kinetic theory, Statistical Mechanics, Axiomatic Thermodynamics, Information Theory, Statistical Estimation, Optimal Transport & Information Geometry, Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics, and recently Contructor Theory. Each of the frameworks have englightened applications in chemistry, plasma physics, quantum mechanics, computation, pure mathematics and even in applied fields like biology, statistics and signal processing. Each perspective helps build a more complete picture on the nature of matter and information and its understanding is helping even in foundational questions like the nature of time.

- An effort in this line of inquiry is directed towards the formulation of the thermodynamics of universal constructors, and its consequences for the nature of computation, biology and time.
- Another line of effort is to use the frameworks of description for thermodynamics for connection with other fields, like symplectic geometry, Information Geometry, and use it for appliactions in imaging and statistics.
