Within the field of foundations of mathematics, a set of tools have been invented in the past one hundred years that remain underused in the sciences. Some of these include [sheaf logics](https://math.uniandes.edu.co/archivos/publicaciones/Logicadeloshacesdeestructuras(Logicofsheavesofstructures).pdf), [paraconsistent logics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-paraconsistent/), [reverse mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Mathematics%3A_Proofs_from_the_Inside_Out), [Homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/), [Higher structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11944), [measurement theory](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/measurement-theory/7D75B72C3E5FA676EA7AD6AB4D8DF4A7) among others. Some of these tools could be used to develop theories of [general observers](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/), [logic in quantum mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08642),Â [hierarchies in biology](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/from-matter-to-life/lifes-information-hierarchy/006CDEF205F1B03F7CBDC087B3CAF513), locally consistent models in ecosystem biology and neuroscience, and perhaps in other fields like economics and social sciences. Moreover, some of these tools are already in use, the tools coming from the field of automated reasoning in logic have been used in software and hardware [verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20hardware,using%20formal%20methods%20of%20mathematics.) and they are currently making a big impact in the mathematical community with proofs assistants like [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/), [Metamath](http://us.metamath.org/), and others. The study of these tools and their results is interesting in itself as well as its possible application outside of mathematics, like in [blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02712) technologies and in material computing verification.

- Some of the efforts in this line of inquiry are aligned with the [empirical metamathematics](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/) and the [multicomputation](https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems/) projects of the Wolfram Physics Project.

- Another line of effort in this topic involves material computing verification in a chemical compiler.
