Within the field of foundations of mathematics a set of tools have been invented in the past one hundred years that remain underused in the sciences. Some of these include, [sheaf logics](https://math.uniandes.edu.co/archivos/publicaciones/Logicadeloshacesdeestructuras(Logicofsheavesofstructures).pdf), [paraconsistent logics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-paraconsistent/), [reverse mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Mathematics%3A_Proofs_from_the_Inside_Out), [Homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/), [Higher structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11944), [measurment theory](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/measurement-theory/7D75B72C3E5FA676EA7AD6AB4D8DF4A7) among others. Some of these tools could be used to develop theories of observers, of hirearchies in biology, locally consistent models in ecosystem biology and nuroscience and perhaps in other fields like economics and social sciences.
