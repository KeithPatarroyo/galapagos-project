Within the field of foundations of mathematics a set of tools have been invented in the past one hundred years that remain underused in the sciences. Some of these include, [sheaf logics](https://math.uniandes.edu.co/archivos/publicaciones/Logicadeloshacesdeestructuras(Logicofsheavesofstructures).pdf), [paraconsistent logics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-paraconsistent/), [reverse mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Mathematics%3A_Proofs_from_the_Inside_Out), [Homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/), [Higher structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11944), [measurment theory](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/measurement-theory/7D75B72C3E5FA676EA7AD6AB4D8DF4A7) among others. Some of these tools could be used to develop theories of general observers, logic in quantum mechanics, of hirearchies in biology, locally consistent models in ecosystem biology and nuroscience and perhaps in other fields like economics and social sciences. Moreover some of these tools are already in use, the tools coming from the field of automated reasoning in logic have been used in software and hardware verification and they are currently making a big impact in the mathematical comunity with proofs assistants like Lean, Metamath and others. The study of these tools and their results is intersting in itself as well as its possible appliaction aoutside of mathematics, like in blockchain technolgies and in material computing verification.

Some of the efforts in this line of inquiry are aligned with the methamatematics project of the Wolfram Physics Project. 

Other line of effort in this topic involves material computing verification in a chemical compiler.
