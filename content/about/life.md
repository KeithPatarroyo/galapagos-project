Several questions are posed here, like What is evolution, really? or What is the difference between technological and living systems? How can we engineer living systems? What are the mechanisms for which nature transitions from distributed systems to autonomous systems and the other way around? How is the presence of an autonomous system changes the dynamics of the processes around him? How can autonomous systems achieve near error-free outcomes? How has nature been able to build such a scalable and robust architecture? How can some of these investigations help us develop new computational paradigms and new manufacturing architectures? Is there a way to generate living systems out of novel materials? How does life itself enter into the whole picture?

- These are the set of questions that we are trying to solve in the [Galapagos Project](https://galapagos.netlify.app/).
